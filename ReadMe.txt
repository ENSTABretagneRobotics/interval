interval
========
- Simple and lightweight C++ interval library with predefined contractors commonly used in robotics (when no guaranteed rounding is needed, otherwise use EASIBEX-CPP (see https://github.com/ENSTABretagneRobotics/EASIBEX-CPP/)). 
- Compatibility with several existing samples published in research papers (e.g. see http://www.ensta-bretagne.fr/jaulin/).
- Ideal to quickly start with intervals while being able to easily apply the results on real robots. 
- Can be used with VIBes (https://github.com/ENSTABretagneRobotics/VIBES/) to easily draw the results of interval computations.
